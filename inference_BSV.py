This script is intended to pull a fully trained LBM(i.e. BSE-BSP-BSV) from GitHub using torch.hub in a tagged release. 
You can then run the pipeline as follows: data --> preprocessed data --> BSE --> BSP --> BSP. 
This script is intended for retrospective visualizations of prediction potential in the data. 
You can adapt this technique to design a realtime implementation for your live data stream.
