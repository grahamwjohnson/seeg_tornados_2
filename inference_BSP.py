This script is intended to pull a fully trained BSP from GitHub using torch.hub in a tagged release. 
You can then run your embedded data (preprocessed data --> BSE --> embeddings) through the BSP. 
This script is intended for retrospective visualizations of prediction potential in the data. 
You can adapt this technique to design a realtime implementation for your live data stream.
